## Introduction

SuperIntervals provides fast interval
intersection queries that integrate with Bioconductor workflows.
This vignette demonstrates practical genomics applications,
showing how SuperIntervals works alongside `GenomicRanges` and `IRanges`.

```{r setup, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(superintervalsr)
library(GenomicRanges)
library(IRanges)
```

## Creating Test Data

Let's first create some realistic genomic data:

```{r simulate_data}
set.seed(123)

# Simulate genes on chromosome 1
chr1_length <- 249000000
n_genes <- 2000

# Create realistic gene distribution with clustering
gene_starts <- sort(sample(1:(chr1_length - 50000), n_genes))
gene_lengths <- sample(c(
  sample(1000:5000, n_genes * 0.6, replace = TRUE),   # Short genes
  sample(5000:50000, n_genes * 0.3, replace = TRUE),  # Medium genes
  sample(50000:200000, n_genes * 0.1, replace = TRUE) # Long genes
), n_genes)

genes <- GRanges(
  seqnames = "chr1",
  ranges = IRanges(start = gene_starts, width = gene_lengths),
  gene_id = paste0("GENE", sprintf("%04d", 1:n_genes)),
  gene_type = sample(c("protein_coding", "lncRNA", "pseudogene"),
                    n_genes, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.7, 0.2, 0.1)),
  expression = round(runif(n_genes, 0, 1000), 1)
)

# Create ChIP-seq peaks
n_peaks <- 5000
peak_starts <- sort(sample(1:(chr1_length - 2000), n_peaks))
peak_widths <- sample(200:2000, n_peaks, replace = TRUE)

peaks <- GRanges(
  seqnames = "chr1",
  ranges = IRanges(start = peak_starts, width = peak_widths),
  peak_id = paste0("peak_", 1:n_peaks),
  score = round(runif(n_peaks, 10, 1000), 1)
)

cat("Created", length(genes), "genes and", length(peaks), "peaks\n")
```

## Core Workflow: From GRanges to IntervalMap

The typical SuperIntervals workflow involves converting `GRanges`
objects to `IntervalMap` for fast queries, then optionally converting
results back to `GRanges` for downstream analysis.

```{r core_workflow}
# Convert GRanges to IntervalMap for fast queries
gene_imap <- IntervalMap(genes, value_column = "gene_id", seqname = "chr1")

# The IntervalMap is ready to use (no need to call build())
cat("IntervalMap created with", length(gene_imap), "intervals\n")

# Basic queries
query_start <- 50000000
query_end <- 60000000

# Find overlapping genes
overlapping_indices <- search_idxs(gene_imap, query_start, query_end)
cat("Found", length(overlapping_indices), "genes in region",
    query_start, "-", query_end, "\n")

# Get the actual overlapping genes using indices
region_genes_gr <- genes[overlapping_indices]

cat("Retrieved", length(region_genes_gr), "genes with all original metadata\n")
print(head(region_genes_gr, 3))
```

## Use Case 1: Finding Genes in Multiple Regions

A common workflow is finding genes in specific regions using batch functions.

```{r gene_annotation}
# Define regions of interest (e.g., from GWAS hits)
gwas_regions <- GRanges(
  seqnames = "chr1",
  ranges = IRanges(
    start = c(10000000, 80000000, 150000000),
    end = c(12000000, 85000000, 155000000)
  ),
  snp_id = c("rs123", "rs456", "rs789")
)

cat("Analyzing", length(gwas_regions), "GWAS regions\n")

# Use batch functions for efficient analysis of all regions at once
gene_indices_batch <- search_idxs.batch(gene_imap, start(gwas_regions), end(gwas_regions))
gene_counts_batch <- count.batch(gene_imap, start(gwas_regions), end(gwas_regions))

# Display results for each region
for (i in seq_along(gwas_regions)) {
  region <- gwas_regions[i]
  gene_indices <- gene_indices_batch[[i]]
  gene_count <- gene_counts_batch[i]

  cat("Region", i, "(", mcols(region)$snp_id, "):",
      start(region), "-", end(region), "\n")
  cat("  Found", gene_count, "genes\n")

  if (length(gene_indices) > 0) {
    # Get the actual genes
    region_genes <- genes[gene_indices]
    cat("  Gene IDs:", paste(head(mcols(region_genes)$gene_id, 3), collapse = ", "),
        ifelse(length(gene_indices) > 3, "...", ""), "\n")
  }
  cat("\n")
}
```

## Use Case 2: Peak Overlap Analysis

Analyze overlaps between different ChIP-seq experiments using SuperIntervals.

```{r multi_sample_peaks}
# Create two peak sets for comparison
set.seed(456)

# H3K4me3 peaks (active promoters)
h3k4me3_peaks <- GRanges(
  seqnames = "chr1",
  ranges = IRanges(
    start = sample(1:(chr1_length-1000), 2000),
    width = sample(200:1000, 2000, replace = TRUE)
  ),
  peak_id = paste0("H3K4me3_", 1:2000)
)

# H3K27ac peaks (active enhancers)
h3k27ac_peaks <- GRanges(
  seqnames = "chr1",
  ranges = IRanges(
    start = sample(1:(chr1_length-1000), 1800),
    width = sample(200:1000, 1800, replace = TRUE)
  ),
  peak_id = paste0("H3K27ac_", 1:1800)
)

cat("H3K4me3:", length(h3k4me3_peaks), "peaks\n")
cat("H3K27ac:", length(h3k27ac_peaks), "peaks\n")

# Convert to IntervalMaps
h3k4me3_imap <- IntervalMap(h3k4me3_peaks, value_column = "peak_id", seqname = "chr1")
h3k27ac_imap <- IntervalMap(h3k27ac_peaks, value_column = "peak_id", seqname = "chr1")

# Find H3K4me3 peaks that overlap with H3K27ac using batch functions
overlapping_indices <- search_idxs.batch(
  h3k27ac_imap,
  start(h3k4me3_peaks),
  end(h3k4me3_peaks)
)

# Count overlaps
overlap_counts <- lengths(overlapping_indices)
has_overlap <- overlap_counts > 0
n_overlapping <- sum(has_overlap)

cat("\nOverlap analysis:\n")
cat("H3K4me3 peaks with H3K27ac overlap:", n_overlapping, "/", length(h3k4me3_peaks), "\n")
cat("Percentage:", round(100 * n_overlapping / length(h3k4me3_peaks), 1), "%\n")
```

## Use Case 3: Distance-Based Gene Association

Find genes within a specific distance of peaks using SuperIntervals.

```{r enhancer_gene}
# Define search distance
max_distance <- 50000

# Create expanded search windows around peaks
peak_subset <- h3k27ac_peaks[1:100]  # Use subset for demonstration
search_starts <- pmax(1, start(peak_subset) - max_distance)
search_ends <- end(peak_subset) + max_distance

cat("Finding genes within", max_distance/1000, "kb of", length(peak_subset), "peaks\n")

# Use batch search to find nearby genes
nearby_gene_indices <- search_idxs.batch(gene_imap, search_starts, search_ends)
nearby_gene_counts <- count.batch(gene_imap, search_starts, search_ends)

# Summarize results
total_associations <- sum(nearby_gene_counts)
peaks_with_genes <- sum(nearby_gene_counts > 0)

cat("Results:\n")
cat("  Total peak-gene associations:", total_associations, "\n")
cat("  Peaks with nearby genes:", peaks_with_genes, "out of", length(peak_subset), "\n")
cat("  Average genes per peak:", round(mean(nearby_gene_counts), 2), "\n")

# Show examples
cat("\nExample associations:\n")
for (i in 1:min(5, length(peak_subset))) {
  if (nearby_gene_counts[i] > 0) {
    gene_indices <- nearby_gene_indices[[i]]
    nearby_genes <- genes[gene_indices]
    cat("Peak", i, "->", nearby_gene_counts[i], "genes:",
        paste(head(mcols(nearby_genes)$gene_id, 3), collapse = ", "),
        ifelse(nearby_gene_counts[i] > 3, "...", ""), "\n")
  }
}
```

## Batch Processing and Performance

SuperIntervals really shines when processing many queries simultaneously.
The batch functions are optimized to minimize call overhead and are much faster.

```{r batch_processing_expanded}
# Simulate query regions (e.g., from another ChIP-seq experiment)
n_queries <- 20000
query_starts <- sample(1:(chr1_length - 10000), n_queries)
query_regions <- GRanges(
  seqnames = "chr1",
  ranges = IRanges(start = query_starts, width = 5000),
  region_id = paste0("region_", 1:n_queries)
)

cat("Processing", n_queries, "query regions\n")

# Demonstrate different batch operations

# 1. Batch counting - most common operation
gene_counts <- count.batch(gene_imap, start(query_regions), end(query_regions))

# 2. Batch index search - for detailed analysis
gene_indices_batch <- search_idxs.batch(gene_imap, start(query_regions), end(query_regions))

# Analyze batch results
overlapping_queries <- sum(lengths(gene_indices_batch) > 0)
max_genes_per_query <- max(lengths(gene_indices_batch))

cat("Batch results:\n")
cat("  Queries with overlapping genes:", overlapping_queries, "out of", n_queries, "\n")
cat("  Maximum genes per query:", max_genes_per_query, "\n")
cat("  Average genes per query:", round(mean(lengths(gene_indices_batch)), 2), "\n")

# Add results to query regions
mcols(query_regions)$gene_count <- gene_counts

# Show distribution of gene counts
gene_count_table <- table(gene_counts)
cat("\nGene count distribution:\n")
print(head(gene_count_table, 10))
```

### Performance Benchmarking: Batch vs Individual Operations

```{r batch_performance}
# Performance comparison: batch vs individual operations
test_queries <- query_regions

cat("Comparing individual vs batch operations on", length(test_queries), "queries:\n\n")

# Individual counting
time_individual_count <- system.time({
individual_counts <- sapply(1:length(test_queries), function(i) {
  count(gene_imap, start(test_queries)[i], end(test_queries)[i])
})
})

# Batch counting
time_batch_count <- system.time({
batch_counts <- count.batch(gene_imap, start(test_queries), end(test_queries))
})

# Individual searching
time_individual_search <- system.time({
individual_searches <- lapply(1:length(test_queries), function(i) {
  search_idxs(gene_imap, start(test_queries)[i], end(test_queries)[i])
})
})

# Batch searching
time_batch_search <- system.time({
batch_searches <- search_idxs.batch(gene_imap, start(test_queries), end(test_queries))
})

# Results comparison
cat("COUNTING OPERATIONS:\n")
cat("  Individual count() calls:", round(time_individual_count[["elapsed"]], 6), "seconds\n")
cat("  Batch count.batch():", round(time_batch_count[["elapsed"]], 6), "seconds\n")
count_speedup <- time_individual_count[["elapsed"]] / time_batch_count[["elapsed"]]
cat("  Speedup:", round(count_speedup, 1), "x faster\n\n")

cat("SEARCH OPERATIONS:\n")
cat("  Individual search_idxs() calls:", round(time_individual_search[["elapsed"]], 6), "seconds\n")
cat("  Batch search_idxs.batch():", round(time_batch_search[["elapsed"]], 6), "seconds\n")
search_speedup <- time_individual_search[["elapsed"]] / time_batch_search[["elapsed"]]
cat("  Speedup:", round(search_speedup, 1), "x faster\n\n")

# Verify results are identical
if (all(individual_counts == batch_counts)) {
cat("✓ Count results identical between individual and batch methods\n")
}

if (all(lengths(individual_searches) == lengths(batch_searches))) {
cat("✓ Search results identical between individual and batch methods\n")
}
```

## Performance Comparison

Here's a brief comparison showing SuperIntervals' performance advantages:

```{r performance}

# Time standard approach
time_standard <- system.time({
standard_counts <- countOverlaps(peaks, genes)
})

# Time SuperIntervals approach using batch functions
time_super <- system.time({
super_counts <- count.batch(gene_imap, start(peaks), end(peaks))
})

cat("Standard countOverlaps:", round(time_standard[["elapsed"]], 6), "seconds\n")
cat("SuperIntervals count.batch:", round(time_super[["elapsed"]], 6), "seconds\n")

if (all(standard_counts == super_counts)) {
speedup <- time_standard[["elapsed"]] / time_super[["elapsed"]]
cat("✓ Results identical, SuperIntervals is", round(speedup, 1), "x faster\n")
}
```
